 Various shapes, including rounded clouds, diamonds, and rectangles, are interconnected by white lines signifying flow. The top left corner features a dark grey cloud labeled "weight," connected by a vertical line to a yellow-brown cloud labelled "volume2." This flows into a red diamond labeled "real weight."  A blue square labeled "location" is positioned to the left. The "real weight" diamond feeds into a red diamond labeled "Zone calculator" which then connects to an orange diamond reading "Zone = Price." This in turn connects to a brown irregular shape labeled with numbers "zone 1 2 3 4 5"  and to a purple irregular shape labeled "Kg and zone Price List".  A final orange rectangle at the bottom, labeled "Final Price" receives a connecting line. The overall composition is clean and technical, emphasizing information flow. The color palette is muted, with the shapes in warm hues against a dark backdrop. The atmosphere is professional and informative.
